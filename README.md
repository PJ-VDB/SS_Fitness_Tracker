<h2> The Program </h2>

I made this application to check my progress while following <a href="http://www.muscleandfitness.com/workouts/workout-routines/4-week-guide-starting-strength" target="_blank"> Mark Rippetoe's Starting Strength program</a>

The aim of the program is to rapidly <b>develop strengths</b> by doing few, but heavy reps, while <b>progressively</b> increasing the weight. It is highly recommended to <b>warm up</b> thorougly before each exercise.

For the program to be most effective, it is recommended to start at a relatively low weight the first week. This will aid in moving forward steadily throughout the program. Most exercises consist of 3 sets of 5 repetitions, the weight is held constant throughout the exercise. Every new workout, the aim is to <b>increase the weight</b> by anywhere between 1-5 kg's. 

Between each set, enough rest must be taken to recuperate so that fatigue should not hinder the exercise. In practice this translates to <b>pauzes of 3 - 5 minutes</b>. 

The program consists of two different days:

Workout A: 
<ul>
  <li>Squat 3x5 (3 Sets of 5 Repetitions)</li>
  <li>Bench Press 3x5</li>
  <li>Deadlift 1x5</li>
</ul>

Workout B
<ul>
  <li>Squat 3x5 (3 Sets of 5 Repetitions)</li>
  <li>Shoulder Press 3x5</li>
  <li>Deadlift 3x5</li>
</ul>

Furthermore, while this workout seems short on paper, time will be spent on the warmup and resting inbetween sets. Strength trainers discourage of adding exercises to this program, as it will overtax the body and hinder progress during the program.

The Starting Strenght Fitness Tracker allows you to pick a date (the date of your workout say). You can then <b>add Workout A or Workout B</b> by clicking on the + in the lower-right corner. Exercises can be <b>removed by swiping</b> them away to the left. One field (the right one) in the exercise bar is clickable, this is where you are supposed to add your weight for this workout. The number next to it gives you the recommended Sets and Repetitions (S x R). When you are then using your Fitness Tracker on the second day, it will automatically show the weight of your previous workout, this allows for easy tracking and keeps you motivated!

Because going on your phone during a workout can be distracting, I have added an <b>in-app timer functionality</b>, this means that you can time your rests within the app. The timer will keep running when the phone is on standby, the <b>icon of the timer on the stand-by screen</b> is clickable to return to the app. 

Furthermore, for you non metric fella's, there is the option to <b>switch to the non-metric system</b>. And finally, if you are extremely excited to <b>share your improvements with your friends</b>, you can send your workout results through various messaging apps to your friends. 

<h2> Instructions </h2>

If you read through all of this, thank you and good luck with your workout! 
The app will maybe be added to the Google Play Store in the future, until then you can install it through the use of Android Studio.

Feel free to tinker with the app yourself (non-comercially please), I have used some libraries/concepts such as SQLDelite (SQLite), AutoValue, cursors, ...
